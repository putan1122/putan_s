# CIS550-Final-Project-Group108
We want to build an interface that allows users to look for books they may be interested in based on
author, genre, publisher, publish year, and/or ratings. Users will also be able to read some reviews
about the books. We intend to build this website as a navigation tool for book lovers to explore more
enchanting books and talented authors
